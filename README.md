## Features
This application was created to extract generation information from the metadata within output images,  
as it was cumbersome to manually store all the details—such as the prompts and Lora weights used during  
generation—when creating images with Stable Diffusion-based generative AI.

It extracts metadata from Stable Diffusion images (ComfyUI / AUTOMATIC1111, etc.) and  
supports loading PNG / JPG / WebP files (with preview support) via drag-and-drop or buttons.

This is the light version, which omits the AI prompt functionality to reduce the overall file size.  
If you primarily want to use it for metadata extraction, this version might be preferable.
